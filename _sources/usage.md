# Usage


## Codec B
Here, we describe the usage of the
`skecg.cs.codec_b` module which contains
the implementation of our proposed codec.

Some example scripts using this module
can be found inside the `scripts` directory.
Below are the basic steps for using the codec.
These steps assume that the ECG signal
has been acquired.



Import relevant modules:

```python
from decimal import Decimal
from jax import random
import skecg.cs.codec_b as codec
```

### Encoding

Prepare the encoder configuration:

```python
n=512
m=256
d=4
w=16
q_nmse_limit = Decimal((0, (1,), -2))
c_nmse_limit = Decimal((0, (2,), -2))
params = codec.EncoderParams(key=random.PRNGKey(0), 
    n=n, m=m, d=d, w=w, adaptive=True,
    q=0, q_nmse_limit=q_nmse_limit, c_nmse_limit=c_nmse_limit)
```


Encode ECG signal into a bitstream

```python
coded_ecg = codec.encode(params, ecg)
```

`coded_ecg` is a (named) tuple
of type `codec.EncodedData`
which
includes the bitstream for the encoded
ECG signal and encoding summary.

Accessing the encoding summary information:

```python
info = coded_ecg.info
print(info)
```

Accessing the bitstream generated by the encoder
```python
coded_ecg.bits
```
You can save the bitstream into a file or
transmit it over the network.

### Decoding

We will be using the BSBL reconstruction
algorithm for decoding. It has a block-size
parameter.

Decode ECG signal from the encoded bitstream:
```python
block_size = 32
decoded_ecg = codec.decode(coded_ecg.bits, block_size)
```

The `decoded_ecg` result is a named tuple
of type `codec.DecodedData`.

Accessing the decoded ECG signal:

```python
decoded_ecg.x
```

We provide a utility function to measure
compression statistics
(bit savings and reconstruction quality):

```python
stats = codec.compression_stats(ecg, coded_ecg, decoded_ecg)
```
