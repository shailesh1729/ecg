# Datasets

## MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database

We use the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database {cite}`moody2001impact`
from PhysioNet {cite}`goldberger2000physiobank`.
The database contains 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel
ambulatory ECG recordings from 47 subjects.
The recordings were digitized at 360 samples per second
for both channels with 11-bit resolution over a 10mV range.
The samples can be read in both digital (integer) form or
as physical values (floating point) via the software provided
by PhysioNet.
We use the integer values in our experiments since our
encoder is designed for integer arithmetic.
We use the MLII signal (first channel)
from each recording in our experiments.


### Beats

Each beat in the dataset is carefully annotated by a mutual
agreement between two cardiologists. There were only a few
beats that were very difficult to interpret and were left
unclassified by the expert annotators.
Different beat annotations found in the dataset and the
number of their occurrences across all the 48 records
are shown in {numref}`tbl:beat:types`.

## Sparsity

In this section, we study the representation of ECG signals
in different wavelet bases.
The primary goal here is to understand the sparsity pattern
of their representations in different bases.
If a signal is suitably sparse on an appropriate basis
(orthonormal or not), then such a basis can be used effectively
for applying an appropriate signal compression method. 
Towards this, we study the sparsity
properties of the wavelet representations of ECG signals
in 106 different wavelets from 7 different families.
The list of wavelets is provided in {numref}`tbl:wavelets`.

## Wavelet Comparison Procedure

The following procedure was employed to estimate the sparsity.

For each wavelet and each record

1. Split the record into blocks of $N=1024$ samples.
   Let there be $L$ such blocks.
1. For each $i$-th block
    1. Compute the $N$ point wavelet transform at maximum level.
    1. Sort the wavelet coefficients by magnitude in descending order.
    1. Count the number of largest magnitude coefficients that capture
       90\% energy of the signal as the number $k_i$.
1. Put together the sparsity of each block into an array $K$.
1. Find the maximum, minimum, and mean values of the $K$ array for the record.
1. Store the $k_{\max}$, $k_{\min}$ and $k_{\text{mean}}$ values
   against the wavelet name and record number.



A sample of $k_{\max}$ values for different combinations of
wavelets and records is shown in {numref}`tbl:kmax:record:wavelet`.

```{table} Maximum sparsity for 1024 sized blocks from a few records under a few wavelets
:name: tbl:kmax:record:wavelet

| 222    | 395     | 226   | 217  | 226    | 311  | 212   | 311 | 219  |
| 231    | 121     | 96    | 104  | 133    | 128  | 80    | 128 | 100  |
| 207    | 368     | 210   | 211  | 218    | 341  | 234   | 341 | 218  |
| 208    | 288     | 165   | 178  | 193    | 248  | 174   | 248 | 172  |

```

## The Biorthogonal 3.1 Wavelet

Analyzing the data across all records and wavelets, we found that
the "bior3.1" wavelet gives the best compressibility performance on average.
A sample of the spread of k values from some records with
bior3.1 wavelet can be seen in {numref}`tbl:k:spread:bior3.1`.
Among this sample of records, one can see that record
117 appears to be one of the simplest ones as the maximum
sparsity level is just 35 while record 200 appears
to be one of the complex ones where the sparsity level
goes as high as 137. We can also see that in all signals,
there are segments that require very few coefficients
(20 or less) for almost lossless representation.
This is indicative of the fact that when the heart is
behaving relatively stably, the ECG pattern is also
less complex.

```{table} Sparsity levels of blocks from some records with bior3.1 wavelet
:name: tbl:k:spread:bior3.1

|    | record | $k_{\text{mean}}$ | $k_{\min}$ | $k_{\max}$ |
|----|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| 0  | 103    | 36.72   | 18     | 53     |
| 1  | 106    | 34.23   | 17     | 68     |

## A Normal Sinus Rhythm

A 1024 sample segment of a normal sinus rhythm
in record 102 is depicted in {numref}`fig:102:signal:10`.
The wavelet coefficients are seen in {numref}`fig:102:wavelet:10`.
One can see that about 50 coefficients are needed to capture
99\% of the signal energy.
Another segment from record 100 in {numref}`fig:100:signal:106`
with wavelet coefficients in {numref}`fig:100:wavelet:106`
shows that the sparsity level for normal sinus rhythm
can be as low as 21. We haven't yet established the
range of variation in the sparsity level for different
types of sinus rhythms under the bior3.1 wavelet.

## A Baseline Wander Segment

{numref}`fig:121:signal:1588` shows an excerpt of
a baseline wander from record 121. It turns out that
the wavelet representation for this signal is
extremely sparse as seen in {numref}`fig:121:wavelet:1588`
with just 7 terms capturing 99\% of the energy.
One can see that most of the energy in this excerpt
is coming from a DC component and a linear trend.
This is why this signal has such a highly sparse
representation. We noticed that very low sparsity
levels tended to correspond to the presence of
linear trends in the data.

## A Complex ECG Segment

One of the most complex segments of ECG waveforms is found in the record 104
at around $320$ seconds. This is shown in {numref}`fig:104:signal:320`.
The corresponding wavelet coefficients using bior3.1 wavelet are shown
in {numref}`fig:104:wavelet:320`. As we can see that the wavelet basis
is unable to represent this part of the signal sparsely. We need
at least $197$ coefficients to capture 99\% energy of the signal.
Such signals are very difficult to handle in a compressive sensing
framework as they don't meet the criteria of sparse representation
on an appropriate basis. It turns out that this particular segment
of ECG is also very hard to interpret. This contains the few beats
which remain unclassified to this date in the MIT BIH Arrhythmia dataset.

## Sparsity Variation for Different Beat Types

We matched the beat annotations in the dataset with
the corresponding 1024 sample blocks and obtained
the corresponding sparsity level for 99\% energy
preservation. We examined the variation of sparsity
level in different blocks for individual beat types.
This data is provided in {numref}`tbl:beat:type:sparsity:var`.
It is interesting to see the significant amount of variation
in the sparsity levels for pretty much all beat types.
For some beat types, there are too few occurrences to
look at the variation in sparsity levels.
