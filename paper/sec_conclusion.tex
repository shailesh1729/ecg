\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The key contributions of our encoder architecture are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We have presented a digital compressive sensing-based encoder
    design including adaptive digital quantization
    and entropy coding which can be
    implemented entirely using integer arithmetic.
    \item We have demonstrated that ANS-based arithmetic coding can
    lead to significant space savings.
    \item We have demonstrated that we don't need a hard-coded
    code-book for entropy coding. We can simply model the
    measurement values distributed as quantized Gaussian values
    for effective entropy coding.
    \item We use simple mean and standard deviation as the entropy model
    parameters which can be dynamically adapted. The overhead of
    the side information is negligible.
    \item We have demonstrated up to $16\%$ of additional space
    savings contributed by the quantization and entropy coding steps.
    \item We have described a complete bitstream specification for
    the carriage of all the side information needed to decode the
    entropy-coded compressive measurements.
\end{itemize}

The software code implementing this codec
and all scripts for the experimental studies conducted
in this work have been released as opensource software
on GitHub \cite{kumar2022ecgcodec}.
