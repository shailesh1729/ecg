\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We summarize the key features and benefits of our encoding scheme.
Our scheme converts digital compressive measurements
to a finite alphabet suitable for entropy coding using
simple adaptive quantization and clipping steps with limited quantization noise.
The quantized measurements can be approximately modeled using a quantized
Gaussian distribution for entropy coding.
ANS entropy coding can efficiently encode them into a
bitstream.
The encoder can be easily implemented using integer arithmetic
on resource-limited devices.
Our entropy coding scheme does not require a fixed codebook.
It can adapt to changing signal characteristics frame by frame. 
% The overhead of encoding the entropy model parameters
% as side information in the bitstream is negligible.
% Frame-by-frame encoding in the bitstream 
% allows us to implement real-time decoding on the receiver side.
We see additional PSS gains of 5-10\% (at higher PMS and PRD)
up to 25\% (at lower PMS and PRD).
% In the low PRD (high SNR) regime, where we need a larger number
% of measurements, our encoding scheme can
% give additional savings in the range of 25\%.
% Even with a low number of measurements (with lower SNR),
% we can get additional space savings of $5-10 \%$.
The decoder can use any suitable reconstruction algorithm.
We have shown it working with BSBL-BO and CSNet.  
% We have described a complete bitstream specification for
% the carriage of all the side information needed to decode the
% entropy-coded compressive measurements.
The codec architecture is general enough to be applied
in other compressive sensing applications also.

The software code implementing this codec
and all scripts for the experimental studies conducted
in this work have been released as opensource software
on GitHub \cite{kumar2022ecgcodec}.

While the quantized Gaussian entropy model has worked okay in this
design, better entropy models require further research.
Lower values of $d$ tend to give better SNR with less number
of measurements. It is unclear why this happens. Surprisingly,
changing $d$ doesn't affect the compression ratio much.
These issues require further investigation.
More work is required in applying this architecture to other
physiological signals. Images are also a candidate for this
architecture. The architecture will need to be modified
to handle multidimensional data.
