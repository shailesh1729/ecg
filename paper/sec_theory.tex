\section{Compressive Sensing}
\label{appsec:cs}
Under the digital CS paradigm, we assume that the
signals have passed through the analog to digital
converter (ADC) and are represented using signed integers
at a specific resolution.

CS is an emerging signal compression paradigm that relies
on the sparsity of signals (in an appropriate basis)
to compress using incoherent measurements.
The basic model can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\by = \Phi \bx + \be
\end{equation}
where $\bx \in \RR^n$ is a signal to compress
(of length $n$). $\Phi \in \RR^{m \times n}$
is a sensing matrix that compresses $\bx$
via linear measurements. Each row of $\Phi$
represents one linear measurement as a linear
functional on $\bx$. $\by$ is a measurement
vector consisting of $m$ distinct measurements
done on $\bx$. By design $\Phi$ is a full
rank matrix. Hence every set of $m$ columns of $\Phi$
is linearly independent. $\be \in \RR^m$ is the
error/noise introduced during the measurement process.
In our digital CS paradigm, the noise is introduced
by the quantization step in our encoder.
In our case, $\bx$ is a window of a raw ECG record
from one channel/lead. 
Often $\bx$ is not sparse by itself but is sparse
in some orthonormal basis $\Psi$ expressed as
$\bx = \Phi \alpha$ and the representation $\alpha$
is sparse. ECG signals exhibit sparsity in wavelet
bases.

Most natural signals have richer structures beyond
sparsity. A common structure is natural signals
is a block/group structure \cite{eldar2010block}. 
We introduce the block/group structure on $\bx$ as
\begin{equation}
\bx = \begin{pmatrix}
\bx_1 & \bx_2 & \dots & \bx_g
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where each $\bx_i$ is a block of $b$ values.
The signal $\bx$ consists of $g$ such blocks/groups.
Under the block sparsity model, only a few $k \ll g$
blocks are nonzero (active) in the signal $\bx$
however, the locations of these blocks are unknown.
We can rewrite the sensing equation as:
\begin{equation}
\by = \sum_{i=1}^g \Phi_i \bx_i + \be
\end{equation}
by splitting the sensing matrix into blocks of columns appropriately.

\subsection{Block Sparse Bayesian Learning}
Under the sparse Bayesian framework, each block
is assumed to satisfy a parametrized multivariate
Gaussian distribution:
\begin{equation}
\PP(\bx_i ; \gamma_i, \bB_i) = \NNN(\bzero, \gamma_i \bB_i), \Forall i=1,\dots,g.
\end{equation}
The covariance matrix $\bB_i$ captures the intra block correlations.
We further assume that the blocks are mutually uncorrelated.
The prior of $\bx$ can then be written as
\begin{equation}
\PP(\bx; \{ \gamma_i, \bB_i\}_i ) = \NNN(\bzero, \Sigma_0)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_0 = \text{diag}\{\gamma_1 \bB_1, \dots, \gamma_g \bB_g \}.
\end{equation}
We also model the correlation among the values
within each active block as an AR-1 process.
Under this assumption the matrices
$\bB_i$ take the form of a Toeplitz matrix
\begin{equation}
\bB = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & r & \dots & r^{b-1}\\
r & 1 & \dots & r^{b-2}\\
\vdots &  & \ddots & \vdots\\
r^{b-1} & r^{b-2} & \dots & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the AR-1 model coefficient.
This constraint significantly reduces the model parameters to be learned.

Measurement error is modeled as independent zero-mean Gaussian
noise $\PP(\be; \lambda) \sim \NNN(\bzero, \lambda \bI)$.
BSBL doesn't require us to provide the value of noise variance
as input.
It is able to estimate $\lambda$ within a algorithm.

The estimate of $\bx$ under Bayesian learning framework
is given by the posterior mean of $\bx$ given the measurements $\by$.



\section{Entropy Coding}
\label{appsec:ec}
From the perspective of entropy coding, a \emph{symbol}
is a unit of information to be transmitted. For us,
each value in a measurement vector is a symbol.
An \emph{alphabet} is the set of all symbols that
can be transmitted. For us, it is the set of integral
values that the entries in a measurement vector can take.
A \emph{message} is a sequence of symbols to be transmitted.
For us, it is the sequence of all measurement values.
There are two primary types of coding schemes: symbol
codes and stream codes. A symbol code (e.g., Huffman code)
assigns a unique bit string to each symbol.
A stream code maps a message (a sequence of symbols)
to a (large) integer. Symbol codes approach optimal
compression only when the Shannon information content
of each symbol happens to be close to powers of $2$.
In particular, Huffman coding is not optimal
since it encodes each symbol using an integral
number of bits. It is not capable of encoding symbols using
fractional number of bits.

In contrast, stream codes can achieve near-optimal
compression for any probability distribution.
Arithmetic Coding (AC) \cite{rissanen1979arithmetic,witten1987arithmetic}
encodes the entire message of symbols into a single (large) integer
enabling fractional bits for different symbols in a message.
A recent family of entropy coders called Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS)
\cite{duda2013asymmetric}
allows for faster implementation
thanks to directly operating
on a single natural number representing the current information.
It combines the speed of Huffman coding with compression rate
of arithmetic coding.
The \emph{constriction} library \cite{bamler2022constriction} provides
a nice way to model each symbol in a message as a sample from
a given probability distribution and then encode it using ANS.
