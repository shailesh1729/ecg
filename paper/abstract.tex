Compressive sensing (CS) is quite appealing
as a low-complexity method for the compression of
ECG data in resource-limited wearable devices.
This paper proposes a codec architecture comprising
adaptive quantization and
asymmetric numeral systems (ANS) based
entropy coding of compressive measurements
that can boost the compression ratio
without sacrificing reconstruction performance.
The quantized Gaussian entropy model for the compressive measurements
is estimated directly from the data and is adapted dynamically
to achieve better compression.
We have tested our encoder with
Block Sparse Bayesian learning
as well as CS-NET sparse recovery algorithms
on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database.
Our encoder can achieve
5-25\% of additional space savings over compressive sensing.
