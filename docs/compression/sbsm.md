# Sparse Binary Sensing Matrices


A (random) sparse binary sensing matrix has a very simple design.
Assume that the signal space is $\RR^n$ and the measurement
space is $\RR^m$.
Every column of a sparse binary sensing matrix has a 1 in
exactly $d$ positions and zeros elsewhere. The indices
at which ones are present are randomly selected for each column.

Following is an example sparse binary matrix with 3 ones in
each column:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

From the perspective of algorithm design, we often require that
the sensing matrix have unit norm columns. This can be easily
attained for sparse binary matrices by scaling them with
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$. The normalization can be skipped during
the sensing process as it allows us to implement the sensing
process entirely using simple lookup and addition operations.
The normalization by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$ will necessarily be
used during sparse reconstruction if the reconstruction algorithm
demands that the columns of the sensing matrix have unit norms.
